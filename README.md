# chest-x-ray-disease-classification
A medical imaging project that uses Deep Learning to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The system compares three different neural network architectures—VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0—to identify the most accurate model for clinical diagnosis.
